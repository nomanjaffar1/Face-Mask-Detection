Face Mask Prediction Classifier

This GitHub repository features a Face Mask Prediction Classifier built with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Achieving 98% training accuracy and 96% testing accuracy, the model utilizes TensorFlow for CNN implementation and Matplotlib for image visualization. Images are preprocessed using OpenCV, offering insights into computer vision techniques. The project provides a practical demonstration of CNNs for mask detection, contributing to public health initiatives. Explore the code, experiment with the dataset, and delve into the intricacies of image classification using deep learning.
